            ðŸŒ» Fascinating Facts About Sunflowers
            Sunflowers (Helianthus annuus) are more than just cheerful blooms; they are botanical marvels with a rich history and impressive traits.
            
            Heliotropism in Youth: Young sunflowers exhibit heliotropism, meaning they turn to face the sun as it moves across the sky. This behavior maximizes sunlight absorption for photosynthesis. However, as they mature, they typically settle facing east, a position that attracts more pollinators by warming the flower head in the morning.

Each floret has the potential to develop into a seed, making the sunflower not just a flower but an entire floral community!
